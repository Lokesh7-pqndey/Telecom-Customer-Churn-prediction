## Why Does Churn Matter?
In today's telecom landscape, customers have more choices than ever. They can effortlessly compare plans and switch providers with minimal friction. As a result, telecom companies face an annual churn rate of **15–25%**, making retention one of the highest-priority business challenges in the industry.
Mass retention campaigns are expensive and inefficient. A smarter approach is to identify *which specific customers* are likely to leave — and intervene early. This project builds a machine learning pipeline to do exactly that: flag high-risk customers before they walk out the door.
Retaining an existing customer costs significantly less than acquiring a new one. Every customer retained directly improves profitability, lowers initiation costs, and grows the network's overall value.
---
## Project Goals
- Quantify the proportion of churned vs. retained customers in the dataset
- Identify the strongest behavioural and demographic indicators of churn
- Train and compare multiple classification models using cross-validation
- Deploy the best-performing ensemble model as the final predictor
---
## Dataset
**Source:** [Telco Customer Churn — Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/bhartiprasad17/customer-churn-prediction/data)
The dataset covers a snapshot of customer activity across the following dimensions:
- **Churn status** — whether the customer left within the last month
- **Subscribed services** — phone lines, internet type, streaming, security, backup, device protection, tech support
- **Account details** — tenure, contract length, payment method, billing preferences, monthly and total charges
- **Demographics** — gender, age group, partner and dependent status
---
## Tech Stack
**Libraries:** `scikit-learn` · `pandas` · `NumPy` · `Matplotlib` · `Seaborn`

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### 1. Overall Churn Rate
![Churn Distribution](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/Churn%20Distribution.png?raw=true)
> Nearly **1 in 4 customers** (26.6%) churned — a significant signal that proactive retention strategies are urgently needed.
---
### 2. Churn by Gender
![Gender Distribution](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/distributionWRTGender.PNG?raw=true)
> Male and female customers churned at virtually identical rates. Gender alone is not a reliable churn predictor.
---
### 3. Contract Type
![Contract Distribution](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/Contract%20distribution.png?raw=true)
> Customers on **Month-to-Month** contracts accounted for ~75% of all churners. Those on longer-term contracts showed dramatically lower attrition — 13% for one-year and just 3% for two-year plans.
---
### 4. Payment Methods
![Payment Methods](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/payment%20methods.png?raw=true)
![Payment Methods vs Churn](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/payment%20ethods%20with%20respectto%20churn.PNG?raw=true)
> **Electronic Check** users had the highest churn rate. Customers on automatic payment methods (bank transfer or credit card) were considerably more loyal — friction in payment may contribute to disengagement.
---
### 5. Internet Service Type
![Internet Services](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/internet%20services.PNG?raw=true)
> **Fiber Optic** subscribers showed a disproportionately high churn rate vs. DSL users — possibly pointing to unmet expectations around speed, reliability, or value.
---
### 6. Dependents
![Dependents](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/dependents.PNG?raw=true)
> Customers without dependents are far more likely to switch providers, possibly due to lower switching costs and fewer household commitments tied to the service.
---
### 7. Online Security
![Online Security](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/onlineSecurity.PNG?raw=true)
> The absence of an online security subscription is strongly linked with churn. Security features appear to act as a **retention anchor** — customers who use them are more invested in the ecosystem.
---
### 8. Senior Citizens
![Senior Citizens](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/seniorCitzen.PNG?raw=true)
> While senior citizens make up a small share of the total base, they churn at a notably higher rate — a segment worth targeting with tailored retention programmes.
---
### 9. Paperless Billing
![Billing](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/billing.PNG?raw=true)
> Paperless billing customers show higher churn. These tend to be digital-native users who are also more likely to shop around and switch online.
---
### 10. Tech Support
![Tech Support](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/techSupport.PNG?raw=true)
> Customers with no tech support subscription are among the most at-risk. Unresolved technical frustrations are a key churn trigger.
---
### 11. Monthly Charges, Total Charges & Tenure
![Monthly Charges](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/carges%20distribution.PNG?raw=true)
![Total Charges](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/total%20charges.PNG?raw=true)
![Tenure](https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/tenure%20and%20churn.PNG?raw=true)
> Higher monthly charges correlate strongly with churn risk. Brand new customers (low tenure) are also significantly more likely to leave — highlighting the importance of the **early onboarding experience**.

## Final Model: Voting Classifier
The three strongest individual classifiers — Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and AdaBoost — were combined into a **soft-voting ensemble** for the final prediction model.
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
clf1 = GradientBoostingClassifier()
clf2 = LogisticRegression()
clf3 = AdaBoostClassifier()
final_model = VotingClassifier(
    estimators=[('gbc', clf1), ('lr', clf2), ('abc', clf3)],
    voting='soft'
)
final_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = final_model.predict(X_test)
print("Final Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
```
```
{
 'LogisticRegression': [0.8413, ±0.0105],
 'KNeighborsClassifier': [0.7913, ±0.0082],
 'GaussianNB': [0.8232, ±0.0074],
 'DecisionTreeClassifier': [0.6470, ±0.0220],
 'RandomForestClassifier': [0.8198, ±0.0116],

 'GradientBoostingClassifier': [0.8446, ±0.0107],
 'VotingClassifier': [0.8468, ±0.0109] ✅ Best

### Final Confusion Matrix
<img src="https://github.com/Lokesh7-pqndey/Telecom-Customer-Churn-prediction/blob/main/output/confusion%20matrix.PNG?raw=true" width="425"/>
> Out of **1,549 actual non-churn** customers, the model correctly identified 1,400. Out of **561 actual churn** customers, it correctly flagged 281. Improving recall on the churn class is the primary opportunity for further optimisation.

## Potential Improvements
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** — Apply GridSearchCV or Optuna to the ensemble
- **Feature Engineering** — Create interaction terms such as charge-per-tenure-month ratios
- **Class Imbalance Handling** — Use SMOTE or class weighting to boost churn recall
- **Model Explainability** — Integrate SHAP values for business-ready interpretability
